# HTML Resume
This is a repository for my HTML/CSS Resume, I may eventually add some JavaScript to it too if it makes sense to! This will be updated over time, and it's really meant more as practice for me creating a beautiful end product with my name attached to it! I hope to provide relevant links here as well, who knows maybe it will become an integral part of my "real" resume!

## Why Wait?
I'm waiting to work on this HTML/CSS Resume for a bit, as I want to learn more about Bootstrap or Foundation or some type of CSS Framework.
Additionally, I'll be finishing up my degree soon, and I want to wait until I can display my education properly. I might come back at some point before then to start working on other sections of the resume.
